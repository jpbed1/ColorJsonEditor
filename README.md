This is a very simple theme editor for Berikai's awesome Bitwig theme patcher found out at: https://github.com/Berikai/bitwig-theme-editor

Note I've only tried this on Bitwig 6 Beta 1 - I've no clue how well it works with other verions of Bitwig or even if it fully works with Bitwig 6 Beta 1.
Its under MIT License - as always caveat emptor, and backup your Bitwig files first.
