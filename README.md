This is a very simple theme editor for Berikai's awesome Bitwig theme patcher found out at: https://github.com/Berikai/bitwig-theme-editor

Note I've only tried this on Bitwig 6 Beta 1 - I've no clue how well it works with other verions of Bitwig or even if it fully works with Bitwig 6 Beta 1.
Its under MIT License - as always caveat emptor, and backup your Bitwig files first.

To Use:
1. Export using Berikai's theme patcher for Bitwig 6 Beta 1 at: 
https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22012005/bitwig-theme-editor-6.0-Beta-1_quickfix.jar.zip

2. Export the existing Bitwig 6 file.
3. Open it up in this editor, and save after edits are complete. Note I've also added a palette manager of sorts you can dork around with.
4. Open back up Berikaik's theme patcher and use it to patch.
